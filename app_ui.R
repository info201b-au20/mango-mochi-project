2020 based on education levels. Notably, those with lower education levels,

    discrepancies during this year. For the past 5 months, the unemployment rate has stayed below a 3% difference.
    However, we discovered something new: that the COVID recession deviates from 'regular' recession trends. Notably in 
    April 2020, when COVID began taking a significant toll, the unemployment rate for women began surpassing 
    men; the opposite of what happened during the Great Recession (2007-2009). We believe this emphasizes
